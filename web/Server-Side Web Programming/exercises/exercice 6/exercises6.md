**Exercise 1:**

Complete the `do-post.php` script to save the data `$name`, `$note`, `$time`, and `$code` on the last line, separated by separators, in the file `data/index.txt`, and then save the comment content, i.e., `$text`, in the file `data/$code.txt`.

**Exercise 2:**

Complete the `index.php` script to load the list of comments `$comments` from the `data/index.txt` file. The structure of the `$comments` array is defined in the `list.phtml` file.

**Exercise 3:**

Currently, the `view.php` script displays the content of each comment by following each link in the list of comments. Create a solution to also display the date, name, and rating.

**Shortest Path Calculation**

**Tasks**

First, add an attribute to the `Arc.java` class to represent the weight of an edge:

- Edge weight: `double weight`

Consequently, modify all the necessary methods in the `Arc.java` and `Graph.java` classes for the construction and manipulation of weighted graphs.

1. Create a class `ShortestPath.java` (for Shortest Path) meeting the following specifications: a shortest path `ShortestPath` is an instance represented by three attributes:
   - A node: `Node target` representing the target node of a shortest path.
   - A node: `Node predecessor` representing the predecessor of the target node on the represented shortest path.
   - A real value: `double distance` representing the distance of the represented shortest path.

2. Add to this `ShortestPath.java` class a constructor (initializing the `target` and `predecessor` fields to given nodes and the `distance` field to `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`), as well as basic accessors and mutators. This class will represent iteratively calculated shortest paths for each node in a given graph.

3. Create a class `Dijkstra.java` meeting the following specifications: an object of this class is an instance represented by four attributes:
   - A graph: `Graph graph` representing the graph for which shortest paths will be calculated.
   - A node: `Node source` representing the source node (from the previous graph) from which shortest paths will be calculated.
   - A `HashMap<Integer, ShortestPath> ongoing` representing the shortest paths still being calculated. This `HashMap` will allow efficient retrieval (in O(1)) of the shortest path for a node with a given identifier.
   - A `HashMap<Integer, ShortestPath> final` representing the finished shortest paths. This `HashMap` will allow efficient retrieval (in O(1)) of the shortest path for a node with a given identifier.

4. Add a `public Dijkstra(Graph g)` constructor to create an object of the `Dijkstra.java` class. Initially, its source node will be set to null, and the two `HashMaps` will be initialized as empty.

5. Add a `public void init(Node src)` method (in the `Dijkstra.java` class) to initialize the calculation of shortest paths from the specified source node parameter. This method will store the source node specified in the parameter in the source field and, most importantly, initialize the `final` and `ongoing` fields.
   - Initially, the `final` field should contain only one shortest path, corresponding to the shortest path from the source node to itself.
   - As for the `ongoing` field, it should contain a shortest path for every node in the considered graph other than the source node: if there is a direct edge from the source node to the node being considered, the distance of the shortest path will be initialized to the weight of the edge (otherwise, the distance will be initialized to `Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY`).

6. Add a `public String toString()` method to the `ShortestPath.java` and `Dijkstra.java` classes to visualize their contents. Use these methods to verify that your initialization method works correctly. This is essential before moving on.

7. Add a `public void compute(Node src)` method (in the `Dijkstra.java` class) to calculate all the shortest paths from a source node. In each iteration, this method will start by searching for the next node to mark (the one in the `ongoing` `HashMap` with the smallest distance) by iterating through all the entries in this `HashMap`. Then, if a new node is found (with a non-infinite distance), this node will be removed from the `ongoing` `HashMap` and placed in the `final` `HashMap`. Subsequently, for all successors of the newly marked node still in the `ongoing` `HashMap`, their respective shortest paths should be updated.
